This is Tianyi Liu, a first year master of School of Information at University of Michigan. 

This is my portfolio.

This portfolio has 5 pages: 

the main page: index.html

project1: subpage/proj1.html

project2: subpage/proj2.html

project3: subpage/proj3.html

photo gallery: subpage/photoGallery.html

Every project page links to the real project page. "PerfumeDaily" and "Ufind" was both my previous course project.

Basic column, menu and breadcrumb layout is based on BootStrap(http://getbootstrap.com/). 
I cover the colors positions and some other settings in my own stylesheet mystyle.css.

copyright of photographs are reserved. Codes are open to everyone, please feel free to use them and welcome to discussing with me!
